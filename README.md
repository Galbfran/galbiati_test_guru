# üîπ Summary
This project is well-structured with a clear separation of concerns:

Reusable UI elements are in the components/ folder.
Business logic is managed in helpers/ and hooks/.
State management is in providers/.
Pages are inside the page/ directory.
Static assets are inside assets/.
This modular approach improves scalability, maintainability, and readability. üöÄ
